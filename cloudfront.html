            <div class="conversation-turn non-tech-question">
                <strong>Non-Tech:</strong> "What exactly is CloudFront and why do we need it? Our website already works fine."
            </div>

            <div class="conversation-turn answer">
                <strong>Developer:</strong> "Think of CloudFront like having multiple convenience stores instead of one central warehouse. When someone in Tokyo wants to buy your product, instead of shipping from New York (slow and expensive), they can get it from a local store in Tokyo (fast and cheap). CloudFront puts copies of your website content in data centers around the world, so users always get content from the location closest to them."
            </div>

            <div class="conversation-turn non-tech-question">
                <strong>Non-Tech:</strong> "How much faster does this actually make our website? Is it worth the cost?"
            </div>

            <div class="conversation-turn answer">
                <strong>Developer:</strong> "CloudFront can reduce loading times by 50-90%! If your server is in Virginia and someone visits from Australia, they might wait 3-5 seconds for images to load. With CloudFront, it drops to under 1 second. Studies show that every 100ms delay costs about 1% in sales. The cost is usually very low - maybe $5-20/month for most small businesses, but the performance improvement is huge."
            </div>

            <div class="conversation-turn dev-question">
                <strong>Developer:</strong> "What's the difference between CloudFront and just using S3 for static content?"
            </div>

            <div class="conversation-turn answer">
                <strong>Expert:</strong> "S3 serves content from one region, while CloudFront caches it globally:
                <br>‚Ä¢ <strong>Performance:</strong> CloudFront is much faster for global users
                <br>‚Ä¢ <strong>Cost:</strong> CloudFront can be cheaper for high-traffic sites (data transfer pricing)
                <br>‚Ä¢ <strong>Security:</strong> CloudFront includes DDoS protection and WAF integration
                <br>‚Ä¢ <strong>SSL:</strong> Free SSL certificates with CloudFront
                <br>‚Ä¢ <strong>Caching:</strong> CloudFront can cache dynamic content too
                <br>For global audiences, always use CloudFront in front of S3."
            </div>

            <div class="conversation-turn non-tech-question">
                <strong>Non-Tech:</strong> "What happens if we update our website? Do users see old content for a while?"
            </div>

            <div class="conversation-turn answer">
                <strong>Developer:</strong> "Great question! CloudFront caches content for a certain period (TTL - Time To Live). You can control this - maybe images cache for 24 hours, but HTML caches for only 5 minutes. When you update content, you can 'invalidate' the cache to force CloudFront to get fresh content immediately. It's like telling all the convenience stores to throw out the old products and get new ones from the warehouse."
            </div>

            <div class="conversation-turn dev-question">
                <strong>Developer:</strong> "How should I configure caching headers for different types of content?"
            </div>

            <div class="conversation-turn answer">
                <strong>Expert:</strong> "Caching strategy by content type:
                <br>‚Ä¢ <strong>Static assets (images, CSS, JS):</strong> Long cache (1 year), use versioned filenames
                <br>‚Ä¢ <strong>HTML pages:</strong> Short cache (5-15 minutes) or no-cache for dynamic content
                <br>‚Ä¢ <strong>API responses:</strong> Very short cache (30 seconds - 5 minutes) or none
                <br>‚Ä¢ <strong>User-specific content:</strong> No cache or use Cache-Control: private
                <br>‚Ä¢ Use CloudFront behaviors to set different caching rules for different URL patterns"

            <div class="conversation-turn non-tech-question">
                <strong>Non-Tech:</strong> "Is CloudFront secure? What if hackers try to attack our website?"
            </div>

            <div class="conversation-turn answer">
                <strong>Developer:</strong> "CloudFront actually makes your site more secure! It includes AWS Shield Standard for free, which protects against DDoS attacks (when hackers try to overwhelm your site with traffic). It also hides your origin server - attackers only see CloudFront, not your actual server. You can add AWS WAF (Web Application Firewall) to block malicious requests. It's like having a security team at every convenience store location."

                <strong>Developer:</strong> "What's Lambda@Edge and when should I use it?"
            </div>

            <div class="conversation-turn answer">
                <strong>Expert:</strong> "Lambda@Edge runs code at CloudFront edge locations. Use cases:
                <br>‚Ä¢ <strong>A/B testing:</strong> Route users to different versions
                <br>‚Ä¢ <strong>Authentication:</strong> Check auth tokens at the edge
                <br>‚Ä¢ <strong>Request/Response manipulation:</strong> Modify headers, URLs

            </div>

            <div class="conversation-turn answer">
                <strong>Developer:</strong> "Absolutely! Mobile apps benefit enormously from CloudFront:
                <br>‚Ä¢ Faster API responses (especially important on mobile networks)
                <br>‚Ä¢ Quicker image and video loading
                <br>‚Ä¢ Reduced battery drain (less time waiting for downloads)
                <br>‚Ä¢ Better experience on slow networks (3G, weak WiFi)
                <br>‚Ä¢ Lower data usage for users (cached content doesn't re-download)
                <br>Your mobile users will notice the difference immediately."

                <strong>Expert:</strong> "CloudFront monitoring tools:
