            <div class="conversation-turn non-tech-question">
                <strong>Non-Tech:</strong> "Why do we need CloudWatch? Can't we just check if our website is working by visiting it?"
            </div>

            <div class="conversation-turn answer">
                <strong>Developer:</strong> "Imagine trying to monitor the health of a 24/7 business by only checking once when you remember. CloudWatch is like having security cameras, health monitors, and performance trackers running constantly. It watches CPU usage, memory, network traffic, error rates, and thousands of other metrics 24/7. It can alert you to problems before customers notice them, and it tracks patterns that help prevent issues."
            </div>

            <div class="conversation-turn non-tech-question">
                <strong>Non-Tech:</strong> "What happens when CloudWatch detects a problem? Does it fix it automatically?"
            </div>

            <div class="conversation-turn answer">
                <strong>Developer:</strong> "CloudWatch is like a smart smoke detector - it detects problems and can trigger automatic responses. For example, if CPU usage gets too high, it can automatically start more servers. If error rates spike, it can send alerts to the team and even trigger automated fixes. It can scale resources up during busy periods and down during quiet times, potentially saving money while maintaining performance."
            </div>

            <div class="conversation-turn dev-question">
                <strong>Developer:</strong> "What's the difference between CloudWatch Metrics, Logs, and Events? When should I use each?"
            </div>

            <div class="conversation-turn answer">
                <strong>Expert:</strong> "Think of them as different types of information:
                <br>‚Ä¢ <strong>Metrics:</strong> Numerical data over time (CPU %, response time, error count)
                <br>‚Ä¢ <strong>Logs:</strong> Text records of what happened (error messages, user actions, debug info)
                <br>‚Ä¢ <strong>Events:</strong> Notifications when things change (instance started, deployment completed)
                <br>Use metrics for performance monitoring, logs for troubleshooting, and events for automation triggers."
            </div>

            <div class="conversation-turn non-tech-question">
                <strong>Non-Tech:</strong> "How much data does CloudWatch collect? Are we going to get hit with huge bills?"
            </div>

            <div class="conversation-turn answer">
                <strong>Developer:</strong> "CloudWatch has generous free tiers! You get 10 custom metrics, 10 alarms, and 5GB of logs free every month. Basic AWS service metrics (like EC2 CPU usage) are free. For most small to medium applications, you might pay $10-50/month. The key is being smart about log retention - you don't need to keep debug logs for years. Set retention periods based on your actual needs."

                <strong>Expert:</strong> "Essential alarms for web applications:

            <div class="conversation-turn answer">
                <strong>Developer:</strong> "Absolutely! CloudWatch can track custom business metrics:
                <br>‚Ä¢ User login rates and patterns
                <br>‚Ä¢ Feature usage frequency
                <br>‚Ä¢ Transaction volumes and success rates

                <strong>Expert:</strong> "Log organization best practices:
                <br>‚Ä¢ <strong>Structured logging:</strong> Use JSON format for easy parsing

                <strong>Developer:</strong> "CloudWatch vs. third-party tools:

                <br><strong>CloudWatch Cons:</strong> Limited application-level insights, basic UI
                <br><strong>Third-party Pros:</strong> Better application performance monitoring, advanced analytics, nicer dashboards
                <br><strong>Third-party Cons:</strong> More expensive, additional complexity, data leaves AWS
