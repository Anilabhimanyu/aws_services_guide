                <strong>Non-Tech:</strong> "I keep hearing about Kubernetes and containers, but I don't understand what they are or why we need EKS. Can you explain?"
            </div>

            <div class="conversation-turn answer">
                <strong>Developer:</strong> "Think of containers like shipping containers for software. Just like how shipping containers standardize how goods are transported, software containers standardize how applications are packaged and run. Kubernetes is like the port management system that decides which containers go where, manages the loading and unloading, and keeps everything running smoothly. EKS is like having Amazon manage the entire port for you."
            </div>

            <div class="conversation-turn non-tech-question">
                <strong>Non-Tech:</strong> "Why is this better than just running our applications on regular servers?"
            </div>

            <div class="conversation-turn answer">
                <strong>Developer:</strong> "Containers solve several problems: First, they ensure your app works the same everywhere (no more 'it works on my machine'). Second, you can pack multiple apps on one server efficiently. Third, if one app crashes, it doesn't affect others. Fourth, scaling is automatic - need more capacity? Kubernetes starts more containers. Need less? It shuts them down. It's like having a smart building that automatically adds or removes rooms based on occupancy."

                <strong>Expert:</strong> "Choose based on your needs:
                <br>‚Ä¢ <strong>EKS on EC2:</strong>
                <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- Lower cost for consistent workloads
                <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- More control over instance types and configurations
                <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- Better for GPU workloads or special requirements
                <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- You manage the worker nodes
                <br>‚Ä¢ <strong>EKS on Fargate:</strong>
                <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- Serverless - no node management
                <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- Pay only for running pods
                <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- Better for variable or unpredictable workloads

                <strong>Developer:</strong> "Kubernetes has complexity, but it solves bigger problems:
