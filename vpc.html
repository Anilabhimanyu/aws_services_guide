            <h2>What is Amazon VPC?</h2>
            <p>Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) lets you provision a logically isolated section of the AWS Cloud where you can launch AWS resources in a virtual network that you define. You have complete control over your virtual networking environment.</p>

            <div class="conversation-turn non-tech-question">
                <strong>Non-Tech:</strong> "What exactly is a VPC? Why can't we just put our servers directly on the internet?"
            </div>

            <div class="conversation-turn answer">
                <strong>Developer:</strong> "Think of a VPC like having your own private office building in a business complex. Instead of having your desk on the sidewalk where anyone can access your files, you have a secure building with controlled entry, private rooms, and security guards. VPC gives you a private section of AWS where your servers can communicate securely, hidden from the public internet, with controlled access points."
            </div>

            <div class="conversation-turn non-tech-question">
                <strong>Non-Tech:</strong> "This sounds complicated. Do we really need all this networking stuff for a simple website?"
            </div>

            <div class="conversation-turn answer">
                <strong>Developer:</strong> "For a simple static website, you might not need VPC complexity. But once you have databases, user accounts, payment processing, or sensitive data, VPC becomes essential. It's like the difference between a lemonade stand (simple) and a bank (needs security). AWS creates a default VPC for you, so you get the benefits without complexity. As you grow, you can customize it for better security and performance."

                <strong>Expert:</strong> "Subnet design patterns:
                <br>‚Ä¢ <strong>Public subnets:</strong> Direct internet access via Internet Gateway
                <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- Web servers, load balancers, bastion hosts
                <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- Resources that need to serve internet traffic
                <br>‚Ä¢ <strong>Private subnets:</strong> No direct internet access
                <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- Databases, application servers, internal services

                <br>‚Ä¢ <strong>Security Groups:</strong> Firewall rules for each server
                <br>‚Ä¢ <strong>Network ACLs:</strong> Additional firewall at subnet level

                <strong>Developer:</strong> "Yes! AWS offers several connection options:
                <br>‚Ä¢ <strong>Site-to-Site VPN:</strong> Encrypted tunnel over internet (quick setup, lower cost)
                <br>‚Ä¢ <strong>AWS Direct Connect:</strong> Dedicated network connection (faster, more reliable, higher cost)
                <br>‚Ä¢ <strong>Client VPN:</strong> Individual employee access from anywhere
